I'm Brian and this is my personal blog. I have no grand plans for it, just grand desires. Until those are satisfied, I'll write posts.

The posts will cover anything I want. Mostly things I'm interested in. Hopefully not much I feel compelled to write about.

I have an idea for a post series on personal workstation bootstrapping techniques with Qubes OS. Stay tuned to see whether I deliver.
